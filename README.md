# Contact List App
This is a simple React app that allows you to manage contacts. It fetches users' data from the API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and provides functionality to add, update, and delete contacts (even though these operations won't actually modify the server).

# Features
Fetch and display users' data from the API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Add a contact (simulated POST call to the API)
Update a contact (simulated PUT call to the API)
Delete a contact (simulated DELETE call to the API)

# I am using axios library to call API's
